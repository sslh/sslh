            In other words, this is the ratio of the projection of the smaller vector onto the larger vector.
            Solves the problem if both vectors point in same direction but are of different lengths (not yet converged)
        similarity='l2' : Compute L2 difference between rows in [n x k] arrays X and Y.

    Optional argument specifies which rows should be ignored

    Two rows with only zeros are assumed to be perpendicular
        (thus nodes without any beliefs in early iterations are assumed not to have yet converged).
    An important assumption is thus that every connected component has at least one node with explicit beliefs).
    It is recommended to first standardize the input matrices before using this function.

        list of rows to ignore [list of explicit beliefs that are not evaluated]
    threshold : float (Default = 0.9962)
        threshold cosine similarity between rows in [n x k] arrays X and Y.

        threshold l2 norm between rows
    similarity : what type of similarity function used, optional (Default='cosine_ratio')
        similarity='accuracy' : "In multilabel classification, this function computes subset accuracy:
            the set of labels predicted for a sample must *exactly* match the
            corresponding set of labels in X." Copied from [sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score]
        similarity='cosine' : Compute cosine similarity between rows in [n x k] arrays X and Y.
            Returns a 1-d array with n entries, one for each row.
            Cosine similarity, or the cosine kernel, computes similarity as the
            normalized dot product of X and Y:
                K(X, Y) = <X, Y> / (||X||*||Y||)
            [Inspired by sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity, but returns simple vector instead of matrix]
        similarity='cosine_ratio' : Use cosine similarity as before, but then also multiply with ratio of lengths.
            In other words, this is the ratio of the projection of the smaller vector onto the larger vector.
            Solves the problem if both vectors point in same direction but are of different lengths (not yet converged)
        similarity='l2' : Compute L2 difference between rows in [n x k] arrays X and Y.
        similarity='l2_matrix' : Computes L2 (Frobenius) *matrix* norm. Thus ignores the threshold attribute and just calculates the matrix similarity

    Wrapper around existing methods to calculate spectral radius.
    1. Original method: function 'pyamg.util.linalg.approximate_spectral_radius'.
    Behaved strange at times, and packages needed time to import and returned errors.
    But kept as default since the other method from scipy sometimes gives wrong results!
    2. 'scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs' which seemed to work faster and apparently more reliably than the old method.
    However, it sometimes does not return the correct value!
    This happens when echo=True and the biggest value is negative. Then returns the next smaller positive.
    For example: returns 0.908 for [ 0.9089904+0.j -1.0001067+0.j], or 0.933 for [ 0.93376532+0.j -1.03019369+0.j]

    http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/etemplates/node138.html

    Both methods require matrix to have float entries (asfptype)
    Testing: scipy is faster up to at least graphs with 600k edges
    10k nodes, 100k edges: pyamp 0.4 sec, scipy: 0.04
    60k nodes, 600k edges: pyam 2 sec, scipy: 1 sec

    Allows both sparse matrices and numpy arrays: For both, transforms int into float structure.
