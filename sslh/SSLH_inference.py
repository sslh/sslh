    """Standard belief propagation assuming a directed graph with two variants:
        V1: one directed potential across edge direction: P is one potential, and W contains the weights of edges
        V2: a set of potentials on different edges: P is a tensor, and W indexes the potentials
    Dimensions of P (2 or 3) determines variant.
    Uses message-passing with division: see [Koller,Friedman 2009] Section 10.3.1.
    Uses damping: see [Koller,Friedman 2009] Section 11.1.
    Can be run either with given number of maximal iterations or until specified percentage of nodes have converged.
    Convergence of a node is determined by (variant of) cosine similarity between *centered beliefs* from two iterations.
    If convergence criterium is reached, the iterations will stop before maximal iterations.
    Parameter "debug" allows alternative, more detailed outputs, e.g., to get intermediate belief values.
    Checks that every entry in X and P are > 0.
    Can model undirected graphs by (1) specifing every edge only for one direction, an d(2) using symmetric potentials.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : [n x k] np array
        prior (explicit) belief matrix.
        Rows do not have to be row-normalized.
        Rows can be all 0, which get later replaced by undefined prior belief.
    W : [n x n] sparse.csr_matrix
        directed sparse weighted adjacency matrix (thus a directed graph is assumed)
        Also allows undirected graph by simply specifying only symmetric potentials
        V1: weight determines the actual edge weight
        V2: weight determines the index of a potential (from potential tensor P)
    P : V1: [k x k]
        any directed potential (no requirement for normalization or identical row or column sums)
        V2: [num_pot_P x k x k] np array
        set of potentials (as tensor)
    numMaxIt : int (Default = 10)
        number of maximal iterations to perform
    convergencePercentage : float (Default = None)
        percentage of nodes that need to have converged in order to interrupt the iterations.
        Notice that a node with undefined beliefs does not count as converged if it does not change anymore
        (in order to avoid counting nodes without explicit beliefs as converged in first few rounds).

        cose similarity (actually, the "cosine_ratio" similarity) between two belief vectors in order to deem them as identicial (thus converged).
        In case both vectors have the same length, then: cos(5 deg) = 0.996194698092. cos(1 deg) = 0.999847695156
    debug : int (Default = 1)
        0 : no debugging and just returns F
        1 : tests for correct input, and just returns F
        2 : tests for correct input, and returns (F, actualNumIt, convergenceRatios)
        3 : tests for correct input, and returns (list of F, list of convergenceRatios)
    damping : float   (Default = 1)
        fraction of message values that come from new iteration (if 1, then no re-use of prior iteration)
    clamping : Boolean (Default = False)
        whether or not the explicit beliefs in X should be clamped to the nodes or not

    Returns (if debug == 0 or debug == 1)

        list of final belief matrices for each iteration, represented as 3-dimensional numpy array

    actualNumIt : int
